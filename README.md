# Next Permutation Exercise

It is necessary to create test cases for the algorithm that can solve the **Next Permutation** of a vector of integers.


# Project description

A permutation of a vector of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.
   ● For example, for vec = [1,2,3], the following are considered permutations of vec: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [3,1,2], [2,3,1].
 The next permutation of a vector of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integers. More formally, if all the permutations of the vector are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that vector is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such an arrangement is not possible, the vector must be rearranged as the lowest possible order
To carry out this exercise, the TDD technique is used. With this technique, the verification of the operation of the solution given to the proposed task becomes more efficient.

## :hammer:Project functionalities

Tests were carried out for the following possible outputs:
`Example 1: ` Input: nums = [1,2,3] Output: [1,3,2]
`Example 2:` Input: nums = [3,2,1] Output: [1,2,3]
`Example 3:` Input: nums = [1,1,5] Output: [1,5,1]
`Example 4:` Input nums =[1,5] throw exception because the vector length < 2
